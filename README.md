### Diagnostics and alarms

Read from the cloud composite status (once per minute) and a slow group of
settings refreshed hourly. Diagnostic entities are listed under the device's
**Diagnostic** section; the rest are operational.

| Entity | Platform | Description | Unit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Problem** | binary_sensor | On while any alarm is active | |
| **Grid connected** | binary_sensor | On while utility power is present (`elecnet_state`); attribute `off_grid_flag` | |
| **MPPT locked** | binary_sensor | On when an aPower MPPT reports status 5 (best-effort: seen with the arc-lock alarm; disabled by default until the healthy value is confirmed, raw list in attribute `mppt_status`) | |
| **Grid export enabled** | binary_sensor | System-level grid export permission (installer setting) | |
| **Rapid shutdown enabled** | binary_sensor | PV rapid shutdown enabled | |
| **Alarm** | event | `raised` / `cleared` transitions with code, name, level, since, equipment, explanation and fix plan; the recorder keeps the alarm history | |
| **Active alarms** | sensor | Number of active alarms; attribute `alarms` lists them | count |
| **Ambient temperature** | sensor | Gateway ambient temperature | °C |
| **Battery pack SOC** | sensor | Raw aPower pack SOC (mean over packs; attribute `per_apower`) | % |
| **MPPT power** | sensor | DC PV power through the aPower MPPTs (attribute `per_mppt`); unit unverified (all captures read 0), disabled by default until it is confirmed against Solar Production | W |
| **PCS state** | sensor | Power electronics state (attribute `per_apower`) | enum |
| **BMS state** | sensor | Battery management state (attribute `per_apower`) | enum |

| **Battery remaining energy** | sensor | Remaining energy reported per aPower, summed; refreshed hourly | kWh |
| **Export mode** | sensor | No export / solar only / solar and aPower | enum |
| **Message** | event | `received` for every new push message (title, content, type, received time); the recorder keeps the message history | |
| **Latest message** | sensor | Title of the newest push message; attributes carry its `id`, `type`, `sub_type`, `content`, `received`, `read` and `messages`, the last 20 messages | |

The device's firmware (`sw_version`) and hardware (`hw_version`) versions are
filled in from the gateway list.

#### Raw payloads

These diagnostic sensors expose the cloud replies verbatim as attributes (no
field renaming, so undecoded fields are visible and queryable from the
recorder history). Every attribute set carries `fetched_at` (UTC) and stays
under the recorder's 16 KB attribute limit; with the captured payloads the
largest, the runtime data, is about 1.5 KB. The runtime data changes every
poll, so expect roughly 2 MB of recorder history per day from it.

| Entity | State | Attributes | Refresh |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Raw runtime data** | mode name | `getDeviceCompositeInfo` `runtimeData` | per poll (≥ 60 s) |
| **Raw composite status** | decoded `deviceStatus` | the composite minus `runtimeData` and `currentAlarmVOList` (`currentWorkMode`, `deviceStatus`, `solarHaveVo`, `valid`, `csipAuxGatewayOnline`) | per poll |
| **Raw alarms** | alarm count | `currentAlarmVOList` verbatim | per poll |
| **Raw aPower info** | aPower count | `obtainApowersInfo` list under `result` (firmware versions, ratings, remaining energy, SOC) | hourly |
| **Raw system settings** | fetch time | `getGatewaySystemSetting` | hourly |
| **Raw warranty info** | expiration date | `v2/warrantyInfo` | hourly |
| **Raw gateway info** | firmware version | the `getHomeGatewayList` entry of this gateway | hourly |
| **Raw export settings** | export mode | `mode` and `limit_kw` from `get_export_settings` | hourly |
| **Raw TOU settings** | current mode name | `get_tou_settings` (`getGatewayTouListV2`) | hourly |

#### Alarm code catalog

`alarm_codes.py` maps all 477 known alarm codes to their English names (from
`selectDeviceRunLogList`) and fills in the name of an alarm the cloud reports
without one. Regenerate it from a fresh capture with
`python3 -I tools/gen_alarm_codes.py <capture.json>`.

#### `franklin_wh_alarm` bus event

Every alarm transition also fires a `franklin_wh_alarm` event on the Home
Assistant event bus (the first poll after startup seeds the active alarms
silently, so a restart does not replay long-standing alarms):

```yaml
event_type: franklin_wh_alarm
data:
  gateway_id: "10060010A01X00000001"
  action: raised            # or cleared
  id: 2756389132
  code: "5144"
  common_code: "5#44"
  name: "NO.1 MPPT The arc lock fault occurs"
  level: 2
  time: "2026-11-10T15:01:30-08:00"
  equipment_sn: "10050019A00X00000001"
  explanation: "The arcing fault of the PV branch x has been triggered multiple times ..."
  plan: "1、Check all connection points ...\n2、...\n3、..."
```

Use it as an `event` trigger, or trigger on the `event.*_alarm` entity's state
changes.

#### `franklin_wh_message` bus event

Every new push message (the list is refreshed every 5 minutes, or at once when
the unread count changes; the first list after startup is seeded silently)
fires a `franklin_wh_message` event with the same attributes the `Message`
event entity records:

```yaml
event_type: franklin_wh_message
data:
  gateway_id: "10060010A01X00000001"
  id: 6569334
  title: "4G signal is poor"
  type: 1
  sub_type: 1
  content: "4G Poor signal. Perform network detection or connect to Ethernet or Wifi."
  received: "2026-11-10T18:49:31-08:00"
  read: false
```

### Controls (some depend on installation accessories and configuration)

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Backup Reserve** | Configure minimum Backup Reserve percentage for current Operating Mode |
| **Operating Mode** | Time of Use (TOU), Self-Consumption, Emergency Backup, [VPP](https://www.franklinwh.com/support/overview/virtual-power-plant) |
| **Grid Connection** | Monitor and control grid connection status |
| **Generator** | Import from Generator Module |
| **Circuits 1** | Control smart circuit 1 |
| **Circuits 2** | Control smart circuit 2 |
| **Circuits 3** | Control smart circuit 3 |
